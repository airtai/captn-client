    "\n",
    "To access the captn service, you must first create a developer account. Please fill out the signup form below to get one:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [https://bit.ly/3I4cNuv](https://bit.ly/3I4cNuv)\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful verification, you will receive an email with the username and password for the developer account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the credentials, use them to get an access token by calling `Client.get_token` method. It is necessary to get an access token; otherwise, you won't be able to access all of the captn service's APIs. You can either pass the username, password, and server address as parameters to the `Client.get_token` method or store them in the environment variables **CAPTN_SERVICE_USERNAME**, **CAPTN_SERVICE_PASSWORD**, and **CAPTN_SERVER_URL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regular authentication with credentials, you can also enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) for generating tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help protect your account, we recommend that you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA provides additional security by requiring you to provide unique verification code (OTP) in addition to your regular sign-in credentials when performing critical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your account can be configured for MFA in just two easy steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To begin, you need to enable MFA for your account by calling the `User.enable_mfa` method, which will generate a QR code. You can then \n",
    "scan the QR code with an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator and follow the on-device instructions to finish the setup in your smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finally, activate MFA for your account by calling `User.activate_mfa` and passing the dynamically generated six-digit verification code from your \n",
    "smartphone's authenticator app.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also disable MFA for your account at any time by calling the method `User.disable_mfa` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single sign-on (SSO) can be enabled for your account in three simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enable the SSO for a provider by calling the `User.enable_sso` method with the SSO provider name and an email address. At the moment, \n",
    "we only support \"google\" and \"github\" as SSO providers. We intend to support additional SSO providers in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before you can start generating new tokens with SSO, you must first authenticate with the SSO provider. Call the `Client.get_token` with \n",
    "the same SSO provider you have enabled in the step above to generate an SSO authorization URL. Please copy and paste it into your \n",
    "preferred browser and complete the authentication process with the SSO provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After successfully authenticating with the SSO provider, call the `Client.set_sso_token` method to generate a new token and use it automatically \n",
    "in all future interactions with the captn server.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "\n",
